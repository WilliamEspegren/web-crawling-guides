1. **Access Settings**: Log into your Spider account and navigate to the settings panel.
2. **Enable Full Resource Storing**: Find the option for Full Resource storing and toggle it on. This will ensure that every resource on the website is archived.
3. **Configure Website Specific Settings**: For specific websites, you can configure these settings within the website configuration screen. This customization can help tailor the archiving process according to the needs of each site.

### Schedule Regular Crawls

Regularly scheduled crawls can help maintain up-to-date archives of your websites. Here’s how to set them up:

1. **Navigate to Crawl Scheduler**: Within Spider, go to the Crawl Scheduler section from the dashboard.
2. **Set Frequency and Timing**: Choose how often you want the crawl to take place (daily, weekly, monthly) and set the specific timing according to your preference.
3. **Select Websites for Crawling**: Choose the websites you wish to include in the regular crawling schedule.
4. **Activate Scheduling**: Save your settings to activate the scheduled crawls.

### Leverage Incremental Crawling

Incremental crawling helps in capturing only the changes made since the last crawl, saving time and storage space. Here’s how to use it:

1. **Enable Incremental Crawling**: In the website configuration panel, enable the incremental crawling feature.
2. **Configure Change Detection**: Set up criteria for change detection, such as monitoring file modifications or specific webpage elements.
3. **Run Incremental Crawls**: Once setup, Spider will only save the changes, making the archive process more efficient.

### Download and Store Data Effectively

Efficient data downloading and storage ensure that you can access your archived data when needed. Here’s how to manage it effectively:

1. **Run Crawls and Download Data**: After running your scheduled or manual crawls, go to the download section to obtain your archived data.
2. **Organize Downloads**: Store the downloaded data in a well-organized file system. Consider using a dedicated folder structure that categorizes data by date or website.
3. **Backup Archives**: Regularly back up your downloaded archives to an external storage solution or cloud-based service to prevent data loss.

### Monitor and Review Archives

Regular monitoring and reviewing of your archives help in maintaining their integrity. Here’s how to perform these tasks:

1. **Periodic Reviews**: Schedule regular reviews of your archived data to ensure everything is captured accurately.
2. **Compare and Validate**: Compare current live websites with your archives to validate the completeness of the stored data.
3. **Issue Tracking**: Keep an issue tracker for any discrepancies or missing elements within your archives, and address them promptly using Spider’s tools.
